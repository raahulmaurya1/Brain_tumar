## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

This study employs a sophisticated approach involving a **customized 3D Convolutional Neural Network** to detect brain tumors by analyzing MRI imaging data.

The methodology involves several key phases:
1.  **Data Loading and Resizing**: MRI images are resized to a standardized dimension of `224x224` pixels to ensure uniformity for network input.
2.  **3D Color Channel Incorporation**: A 3D color channel is incorporated to enhance the network's ability to capture intricate spatial features within MRI scans. This translates MRI images into numerical arrays, preserving spatial and intensity information crucial for detection.
3.  **Input Reshaping**: Numerical arrays are reshaped to conform to the specific input requirements of the customized 3D CNN model.
4.  **Customized CNN Architecture**: The model is meticulously designed with multiple convolutional layers for high-dimensional feature extraction, interspersed with max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality while retaining essential features. Fully connected layers integrate learned features, leading to a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

The hyperparameters for the proposed customized CNN model are as follows:

| Hyperparameter | Value |
| :------------- | :---- |
| Learning Rate | 0.001 |
| Batch Size | 32 |
| Epochs | 50 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Dropout Rate | 0.3 |
| Activation Function | ReLU |
| Output Activation | Softmax |
| Loss Function | Binary Crossentropy |

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture (Detailed)

The proposed CNN model is a customized 3D Convolutional Neural Network (as depicted in Figure 1 of the paper). Its architecture is built to focus on picking out important features, which plays a significant role in accurately spotting tumors.

The detailed architecture of the proposed tailored CNN model is as follows:

| Layer (Type) | Filter Size | Kernel Size | Strides | Output Shape | Number Of Parameters |
| :----------- | :---------- | :---------- | :------ | :----------- | :------------------- |
| Conv2D | 32 | $3\times3$ | | $112\times112\times16$ | 448 |
| Conv2D(1) | 32 | $3\times3$ | | $56\times56\times16$ | 2320 |
| MaxPooling2D | | | $2\times2$ | $28\times28\times16$ | 0 |
| Conv2D (2) | 64 | $3\times3$ | | $14\times14\times32$ | 4640 |
| Conv2D (3) | 64 | $3\times3$ | | $7\times7\times32$ | 9248 |
| MaxPooling2D (1) | | | $2\times2$ | $4\times4\times32$ | 0 |
| Conv2D (4) | 128 | $3\times3$ | | $2\times2\times64$ | 18496 |
| Conv2D (5) | 128 | $3\times3$ | | $1\times1\times64$ | 36928 |
| MaxPooling2D (2) | | | $2\times2$ | $1\times1\times64$ | 0 |
| Flatten | | | | 64 | 0 |
| Dense | | | | 256 | 16640 |
| Dense (1) | | | | 128 | 32896 |

| **Total Parameters** | | | | | **121744** |
| **Trainable Parameters** | | | | | **693505** |
| **Non-trainable Parameters** | | | | | **0** |

The input size is reshaped to $(512\times1024\times3)$. The network starts with a convolutional layer of 32 filters, each $(3\times3)$ kernel size, outputting $(112\times112\times16)$. Subsequent layers include more convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes and max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction. The final layers consist of flattened output passed through fully connected (Dense) layers, with the last layer employing a softmax activation function for precise predictions.
